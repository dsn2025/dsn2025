    <h2 id="bpa"><b>DSN 2024 Best Paper Award</b></h2>
    <p>DSN attributes a Best Paper Award to one of the accepted scientific
    papers. The selection of the candidate papers for the award is carried out
    first by the Program Committee that picks up to six of the accepted papers;
    then, the Steering Committee chooses among these six papers the three
    candidate papers to be presented in a special session at the conference;
    finally, the audience at the conference votes for the paper that should
    receive the award.</p>

    <h2 id="carter"><b>DSN 2024 William C. Carter PhD Dissertation Award in Dependability</b></h2>
    <p>The award aims at recognizing an individual who has made a significant
    contribution to the field of dependable and secure computing throughout his
    or her PhD dissertation.</p>
 
    <p>To be eligible for the award, the nominee’s PhD defense must be
    completed prior to the nomination deadline and must have occurred no more

    <h2 id="artifact"><b>DSN 2024 Distinguished Artifact Award</b></h2>

    <p>DSN supports open science, where authors of accepted papers are encouraged to make their tools and datasets publicly available to ensure reproducibility and replicability by other researchers. New this year, DSN 2024 will offer a separate artifact evaluation track to all accepted papers from all three categories of the research track. The goals of the artifact track are to (1) increase confidence in a paper’s claims and results, and (2) facilitate future research via publicly available datasets and tools.</p>

    <p>All artifacts submitted will compete for a “<b>Distinguished Artifact Award</b>” that is sponsored by KAUST (<a href="https://www.kaust.edu.sa/">https://www.kaust.edu.sa/</a>), to be decided by the committee. This will be awarded to the artifact that (1) has the highest degree of reproducibility as well as ease of use and documentation, (2) allows other researchers to easily build upon the artifact’s functionality for their own research, and (3) substantially supports the claims of the paper. We anticipate that at most one artifact (paper) would get the award, though the committee reserves the right not to award any artifact in a given year if none of them meet the criteria for the award.
